**Introducing the Future of Commuting: The Solo (Not!)**
Tired of sharing your car? Wish you could squeeze through that tight parking spot? Yearn for a self-driving experience, but also want to show off your… individuality?
Feast your eyes on the Solo (Not!), the single-person commuter car of the future that's so exclusive, it's practically unattainable!
**Features (that you probably can't afford):**
*   **Hallway-Friendly Compact Design:** Finally, a car that fits in your hallway! Okay, maybe a *really* wide hallway. But still, it's compact!
*   **Self-Driving (If you pay):** Let our AI chauffeur you around… once the software update is released… and the satellites align… and you pay the subscription fee.
*   **Safety… Kinda:** We’ve packed it with sensors!
*   **Long (ish) Range:** Go the distance! Or, you know, to the next charging station.
*   **Multi-Use (Debatable):** It's a car! It's a personal isolation pod! It's… well, mostly just a car.
  
**The Solo (Not!) - Because mass transit is for *other* people.**
**(Not available in most areas. May spontaneously combust. Driver assumes all responsibility.)**
